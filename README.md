# Probability-Distribution-Using-GUI
![probdistgui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37298971/37386587-4f8e9566-2783-11e8-9024-19fa1d9e5ccf.png)

It was an academic project where probability distribution of univariate or bivariate data was estimated and plotted using MATLAB Graphical User Interface.
# How to RUN!

1. Executing ProbDistGUI.m file GUI window will be appeared but none of the button wil work unless data file is loaded. 
2. I dave added two data file for Univariate data and Bivariate data.
3. Load the data.
4. For univariate data only Plot and Hist buttons work.
5. Surf and Contourf buttons are for bivariate data. 
6. To calculate probability click on Probability button and another smaller window will appear to take the range of probabilty as input.

# Buttons Description
I have shortened the name of buttons. Here are some explanations of buttons in a nutshell.
1. Plot: It plots the probability distribution function for univariate data but for bivariate data it only plots the data value. 
2. Hist: It plots the histogram of the data for both univariate and bivariate data. 
3. Surf: It plots the surface plot of bivariate data.
4. Contourf: It plots the contour plot of bivariate data.
