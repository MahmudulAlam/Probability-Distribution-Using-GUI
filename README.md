# Probability-Distribution-Using-GUI
![probdistgui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37298971/37386587-4f8e9566-2783-11e8-9024-19fa1d9e5ccf.png)

It was an academic project where probability distribution of univariate or bivariate data was estimated and plotted using numerical technique in MATLAB. I have made the Graphical User Interface for it for user friendly manipulation.

# How to RUN!

1. Executing ProbDistGUI.m file GUI window will be appeared but none of the button will work unless data file is loaded. 
2. I have added two data file for Univariate data and Bivariate data.
3. Load the data.
4. For univariate data only Plot and Hist buttons work.
5. Surf and Contourf buttons are for bivariate data. 
6. To calculate probability click on Probability button and another smaller window will appear to take the range of probabilty as input.

# Buttons Description
I have shortened the name of buttons. Here are the explanations of buttons in a nutshell.
1. Plot: It plots the probability density function for univariate data but for bivariate data it only plots the data value. 
2. Hist: It plots the histogram of the data for both univariate and bivariate data. 
3. Surf: It plots the probability density function of bivariate data which is a surface.
4. Contourf: It plots the contour plot of bivariate data. 

Another popup option have added to change the colormap for visual conveniences.
